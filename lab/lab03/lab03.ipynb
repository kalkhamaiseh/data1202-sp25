Lastly, you'll create tables and practice analyzing them with your knowledge of table operations.

The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",

    "> How big was the population in each year, rounded to the nearest million?\n",
    "\n",
    "Rounding is often used with large numbers when we don't need as much precision in our numbers. One example of this is when we present data in tables and visualizations. \n",

    "We could try to answer our question using the `round` function that is built into Python and the `item` method you just saw. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** the `round` function takes in two arguments: the number to be rounded, and the number of decimal places to round to. The second argument can be thought of as how many steps right or left you move from the decimal point. Negative numbers tell us to move left, and positive numbers tell us to move right. So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200.0. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8."

    "An array is useful for describing a single attribute of each element in a collection. For example, let's say our collection is all US States. Then an array could describe the land area of each state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Tables extend this idea by containing multiple columns stored and represented as arrays, each one describing a different attribute for every element of a collection. In this way, tables allow us to not only store data about many entities but to also contain several kinds of data about each entity. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the cell below we have two arrays. The first one, `population_amounts`, was defined above in section 3.2 and contains the world population in each year (estimated by the US Census Bureau). The second array, `years`, contains the years themselves. These elements are in order, so the year and the world population for that year have the same index in their corresponding arrays."
